# googlephotosscraper
This is an Express Server built to be hosted on Vercel to scrape a public google photos album and return all image urls back as json data.

<ol>
<li>Clone the repo</li>
<li>Upload the repo to be a new vercel project</li>
<li> The postAPI.js file contains the template code to use on a client side JS file to make a POST request to the vercel API. Replace the albumURL name with the googlephotos you want to scrape. Then change the fetch URL to your vercel domain name with /api at the end </li>
</ol>
